Notes for PD 

Selector = data type
Object sees selector in message and assigns an appropiate method to deal with it. 

Messages = type aware. Can be anything. Float, bang, symbolic (ex text).

CTRL 1-8 places objects GUI. 

List has its own selector. 

There are pointers in PD. Not so easy. 

Array is a position in memory and can be viewed/modified by a graph. If you store a sound file in an array it will put it into the pd file (patch) and it will be huge. Table is two dimensional.

You can view two arrays with one single graph (use "in last graph" option when creating array). 

In/out = tabread and tabwrite (tabread~ and tabwrite~ for audio signals)
